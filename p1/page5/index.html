		<h1>Mark Howerton Goes on Trial for the Murder of Cayley Mandadi</h1>
			<p> In December 2019, two years after Cayley Mandadi's disturbing demise, Mark Howerton is finally brought to trial for allegedly kidnapping, assaulting and murdering her.</p>
			<p>JUDGE: How do you plead, Mr. Howerton.</p>
			<p>MARK HOWERTON:  Not guilty, your honor.</p>
			<p><b>Peter Van Sant:</b> What was it like to see Mark Howerton in the courtroom?</p>
			<p><b>Alison Steele:</b> Like everybody else, I'd try not to look at him too much</p>
			<p>The trial begins with prosecutor Alessandra Cranshaw's opening statement.</p>
			<p>ALESSANDRA CRANSHAW (in court): I think the best way to tell this story … is to start where Cayley Mandadi's life ended. And that's in the car of this defendant.</p>
			<p>Prosecutors allege that Howerton forcefully escorted Cayley from the Mala Luna Music Festival to his car. He then drove her to a parking lot where he sexually assaulted and beat her, causing a fatal brain bleed. Cranshaw presented photos showing Cayley's condition about 18 hours after she arrived at the hospital.</p>
			<p>ALESSANDRA CRANSHAW (in court): Cayley is covered with bruises from head to toe … I believe that you will have no reservations about finding this defendant guilty of the offense of murder.</p>
			<p>JOHN HUNTER (in court):Things are not always as they seem.</p>
			<p>In his opening statement, defense attorney John Hunter attacks the very foundation of the prosecution's case.</p>
			<p>JOHN HUNTER (in court): Mark Howerton did not cause Cayley's death.</p>
			<p>JOHN HUNTER (in court): No one saw anything that transpired between Mark Howerton and Cayley Mandadi that evening on the 29th. There are no eyewitnesses.</p>
			<p>The state begins its case with paramedic Sharyl Lane, who was driving an ambulance up to the Luling hospital that night when a vehicle suddenly appeared behind her.</p>
			<p>SHARYL LANE (in court): There's a black car behind us honking and flashing the lights. … Before I even get out, I see a gentleman that's hollering and screaming. I open the door. He's telling me that — his girlfriend is not breathing. And he needs help.</p>
			<p>When Lane looked inside Howerton's car, she saw a disturbing scene.</p>
			<p>SHARYL LANE (in court): She was exposed … And her pants and her clothes … were in the floorboard by her feet. … She … had bruises on her, just multiple bruises that I just remember seeing. … that's when I started CPR.</p>
			<p>But Hunter says not everyone at the hospital believed Cayley had been attacked.</p>
			<p><b>John Hunter:</b> The treating physician at the Luling hospital — approached this as a drug overdose.</p>
			<p><b>Peter Van Sant:</b> Wasn't that because Mark had told them he thought she had overdosed?</p>
			<p><b>John Hunter:</b> Correct. But the symptoms she was presenting were consistent with that patient history.</p>
			<p><b>Peter Van Sant:</b> Was this woman beaten or not?</p>
			<p><b>John Hunter:</b> No.</p>
			<p>Hunter insists the photos showing bruising on Cayley don't point to foul play.</p>
			<p><b>John Hunter:</b> By the time that the sexual assault nurse … photographs her … she has been resuscitated. Six times, I believe. Maybe eight. … She's had a chest tube inserted. She's had IVs placed on both arms. … She's been worked over by those physicians at the Luling hospital in a traumatic way.</p>
			<p>While the medical team fought for Cayley's life, police interviewed and photographed Mark Howerton. Police officer Chris Adams.</p>
			<p>DAVID LUNAN | Prosecutor: Do they look red to you?</p>
			<p>OFFICER CHRIS ADAMS: Yes, sir.</p>
			<p>DAVID LUNAN: Unusually red?</p>
			<p>OFFICER CHRIS ADAMS: Yes, sir.</p>
			<p>Evidence, investigators believe, that Howerton did hit Cayley.</p>
			<p>DEPUTY CALENTINE (to Howerton on bodycam): Those actually do look like they have scabs already on them.</p>
			<p>The Mark Howerton arrested after Cayley's death was an enormously muscled, intimidating figure. Cayley's friends say he used steroids.</p>
			<p><b>Christy Jack:</b> … even in such a confined space. … it would've been relatively easy for him to cause that kind of damage to her head.</p>
			<p>Howerton initially cooperated with investigators, allowing police to search his Mercedes, where they found a gun and marijuana.</p>
			<p><b>John Hunter:</b> If he was worried about himself, he would have told the police to get a warrant.</p>
			<p>Instead, Hunter says, Howerton was much more concerned about Cayley.</p>
			<p>MARK HOWERTON (police interview): Can I find out an update on her, please? Is there any way?</p>
			<p>The only person who could counter Howerton's story was dead. Investigators hoped Cayley's remains might speak on her behalf. Dr. Suzanna Dana performed the autopsy and <a href="../page6/index.html">said the evidence shows Cayley was beaten to death.</a></p>
