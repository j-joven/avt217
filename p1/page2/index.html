		<p>Cayley Mandadi, 19, was a sophomore at Trinity University when she was brought to a Texas hospital on Oct. 29, 2017. She was nearly naked, bruised and not breathing. Her sometime boyfriend Mark Howerton told doctors they'd taken ecstasy at a music festival and she passed out after consensual sex in his car. She died at the hospital.</p>
		<p>In February 2018, authorities charged Howerton with Mandadi's murder, alleging her cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. A year later, Howerton's trial ended with a hung jury.</p>
		<p>A new trial was set for 2023. Mandadi's mother Alison Steele and stepfather Lawrence Baitland believed for the second trial jurors needed more information about what happened inside Howerton's car. Steele, a scientist, and Baitland, a NASA engineer, launched their own investigation.</p>
		<p>"I needed to be able to show the jury what happened to Cayley," Baitland told "48 Hours" correspondent Peter Van Sant.</p>
		<p>Using autopsy photos and consulting with experts, they developed a theory.</p>
		<p>Would the couple's investigation change the course of the second trial?</p>
